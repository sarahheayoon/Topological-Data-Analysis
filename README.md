# Topological-Data-Analysis
Ken Cooke Summer Research (Pomona College Math Department) 

## Motivation behind the research: 


## This repository includes three sections. 
- Notes on Persistence Homology and its applications (Python codes for TDA modeling)
- Notes taken from "Practical Time Series Analysis" - more detailed notes and problem sets can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/sarahheayoon/Practical-Time-Series-Analysis-Prediction-With-Statistics-And-Machine-Learning-Notes)
- Excercises and solutions on Applications of Persistence to Time Series Data Analysis in R & Python 

## Acknowledgement
I would like to give special thanks to my advisor, Professor. Vin de Silva and Pomona College Math Department for the fellowship grant. 
I would also like to thank Anna Song and Yueqi for guiding me through the TDA python package 'gudhi' and 'giotto-tda'
