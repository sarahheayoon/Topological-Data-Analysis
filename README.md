# Topological-Data-Analysis
Ken Cooke Summer Research (Pomona College Math Department) 

## Motivation behind the research: 
Over the past two years, I studied Topology as my thesis topic. Topology can provide an interesting lens to understand higher dimensional data structures by studying its topological invariants such as homology and the Euler characteristics. For example, for my thesis, I explored applications of topology in neuroscience. Given measurements of co-activation strength between neurons, it is possible to quantify the degree of geometric organization in neural activity. This is a fundamental step in understanding the functionality of brain circuity. For the Ken Cooke summer research project, I wanted to explore the applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

One of the biggest benefits of TDA is that it decreases the dimensionality of high dimensional data. In doing so, it allows one to analyze the underlying structures of data. 

## This repository includes three sections. 
- Applications of Persistence to Time Series Data Analysis in R & Python
- Notes on Persistence Homology and its applications
- Notes taken from "Practical Time Series Analysis" (more detailed notes and problem sets can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/sarahheayoon/Practical-Time-Series-Analysis-Prediction-With-Statistics-And-Machine-Learning-Notes)

## Acknowledgement
I would like to give special thanks to my advisor, Professor. Vin de Silva. I would also like to thank Anna Song and Yueqi for guiding me through the TDA python package 'gudhi' and 'giotto-tda'
