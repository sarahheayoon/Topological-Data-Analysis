# Topological-Data-Analysis
Ken Cooke Summer Research (Pomona College Math Department) 

## Motivation behind the research: 
The primary goal of this proposed research is to finish up work initiated in my senior thesis this year, “Topological Modeling of Higher-Dimensional Complex Data.” Topology is a tool to understand higher dimensional vector spaces using toplogical invariants such as homology and the Euler characteristics. My motivation for the thesis was to understand a different approach to modeling complex data. The classes that influenced the narrative of my thesis were MATH154 ‘Computational Statistics’ and MATH 158 ‘Statistical Linear Modeling,’ which I took in my senior year. I was interested in the ways computational statistics intersects with deterministic/stochastic mathematical modeling. With the thesis (MATH 191), I was able to understand the fundamentals of topology and how it can be used to model and understand higher-dimensional shapes. Originally, the last chapter of the thesis was dedicated to applications in the real world. I was curious how topological modeling of higher-dimensional data can be useful in understanding complex data shapes. I was curious how these topological methods might be better, or worse, in certain areas of data analysis compared to the traditional machine learning methods in visualizing data and predicting an outcome.
